Because. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk27.flac
Cause effect everything happens because of course. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk28.flac
So in the same things happen over and over again. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk29.flac
And so by taking the time to write them down. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk30.flac
And then seeing how those criteria would have worked over a period of time i can get respect. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk31.flac
Until i wrote down those printer. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk32.flac
Is hashem mentioned. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk33.flac

Economic and investment principles and then look at the world through the perspective of those print. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk43.flac
Numbers rather than just tell you what i think. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk44.flac
I want to tell you how it works. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk45.flac
And then we can apply that mechanics you can decide that work that way. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk46.flac
Or not so all these principal. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk47.flac
Valuable because if you know. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk48.flac

It's like it's giving out like i'm giving them the fish ability to fish rather than to just. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk51.flac
I can tell you what i said. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk52.flac
These principles are right then you can apply them yourself. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk53.flac
Two weather. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk54.flac
Circumstance. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk55.flac
So. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk56.flac
I broke it down in terms of economic principles. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk57.flac
Investment principles because. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk58.flac
The market. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk59.flac
The economy. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk60.flac
So in order to understand. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk61.flac
Economics and other markets you have to understand. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk62.flac
An ordinance in the market you have done staying in a corner. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk63.flac
So. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk64.flac
I want to describe how i think the economy work. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk65.flac
To perpetual motion. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk66.flac
There are four big force. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk67.flac
Three important equilibriums in tool. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk68.flac
Get this down. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk69.flac
Just basically everything through my eyes. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk70.flac
Is a long as. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk71.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk72.flac
Over period of time we raise our living standards because we learn how to do things better we become more of fish. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk73.flac
That's quite productivity. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk74.flac
Fermanagh. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk75.flac
A map is something about over a period of time. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk76.flac
That is because it is not something that. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk77.flac
Is a big thing that we see isn't it. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk78.flac
But it's the most important thing over a period of time. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk79.flac
The big things that we seeing people everyday or depths. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk80.flac
There's a short-term debt cycle is a long-term debt. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk81.flac
When i say a short-term debts. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk82.flac
Here's what we think of is normally the business. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk83.flac
Right you have a recession you have a weakness in a car. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk84.flac
When the rate of economic activity is too low. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk85.flac
Then central banks produce. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk86.flac
Credit. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk87.flac
Credit is buying tower. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk88.flac
So yeah produce that credit it makes purchases of goods services and financial assets happen. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk89.flac
So the economy picks up. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk90.flac
That cycle usually lasts. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk91.flac
7 to 10 years. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk92.flac
As the economy picks up. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk93.flac
I'm the demand rises relative to the capacity as you get later in the cycle the central line puts the brakes on it they raise interest rates. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk94.flac
As the interest rates go slow up and that's the cycle right and because. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk95.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk96.flac
Our power. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk97.flac
By providing you. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk98.flac
And that means the obligation to pay back. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk99.flac
And so by it's very nature is cyclical first comes the stimulation then comes the pain back which means you when you when you produce credit you can spend more than you were. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk100.flac
And when you pay back. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk101.flac
You have to. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk102.flac
Spend less than you are and that's the nature of the psyche. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk103.flac
And without cycle goes market cycles which will talk. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk104.flac
That's what i mean by the short-term get cycle. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk105.flac
Results of the term dates. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk106.flac
Which is the accumulation of all of them. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk107.flac
Depots short-term debt cycle. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk108.flac
Because. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk109.flac
Everybody things to go up. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk110.flac

And then when interest rates of 0 they can do that anymore. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk118.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk119.flac
We come to the need to print money and buy for me and two acids which we go quantitative easing. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk120.flac
And when they were there a limit. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk121.flac
We come to the end of the long-term debt cycle. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk122.flac
So cycle on productivity. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk123.flac

Period that were going through. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk132.flac
2018-9 there was a debt cycle. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk133.flac
An interest rates of 0. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk134.flac
And that's very similar to 1929 to 32 there was a debt crisis. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk135.flac
An interest rate of 0. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk136.flac
Both of those cases. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk137.flac
There was the printing of money in the bank. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk138.flac
Which caused those financial asset prices to go up. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk139.flac

And as a result of that in the 1930s as also happened now politics entered into the picture. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk148.flac
So as we seeing in the world right now that issue of. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk149.flac

Very much like to 30. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk156.flac
In which a rising power. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk157.flac

Has a challenging existing power in the form of the united states. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk162.flac
And if we look at histories and cycles of though. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk163.flac
Period. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk164.flac
There is a cycle of. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk165.flac
Conflict and peace. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk166.flac
It happens after war because some dominant country. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk167.flac
When's the war nobody wants to buy. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk168.flac

These things have happened over and over. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk174.flac
So centres.in can affect. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk175.flac
Leave the cycle. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk176.flac

What's happened. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk181.flac
I compare it to three. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk182.flac
What are these three equilibria. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk183.flac
First. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk184.flac
The depp roles has to be in line with the income growth that's required to service the debt. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk185.flac
Stepbro is faster than the income growth that's going to service the debt. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk186.flac
We're going to have just. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk187.flac
And so i'm always doing the pro forma what is the ability to service that debt. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk188.flac
So that's what i'm watching. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk189.flac
Second equilibrium. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk190.flac
Is there the rate of economic activity. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk191.flac
Economic capacity euros. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk192.flac
Is neither too high or too low what that means. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk193.flac
Is if you have a pressing up too much of an overheating economy. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk194.flac
That's going to be quite tight in the monetary policy in the car. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk195.flac
And if you have a too low so that the economy is depressed. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk196.flac
And there's a lot of swag that's going to cause an adjustment to bring it. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk197.flac
In so i'm always watching where are we relative to that because that's a key driver of that of the psycho. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk198.flac
And the third. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk199.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk200.flac

Recipe memes and discount rates and i'm going to get into that the minute. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk561.flac
And then investment is a return street everyday you can market to the market you know what it's like. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk562.flac
I'm so the key is to be able to put together portfolio hours of return string. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk563.flac
So that day balance well as i should. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk564.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk565.flac

There are 10 life at bridgwater. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk567.flac
Has to do with knowing how to deal with. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk568.flac
More than anything we know. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk569.flac
Because what you don't know is a lot. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk570.flac
And if and you can reduce your risk. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk571.flac
More than you could reduce your return by no he had a diversified well. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk572.flac
So the versification can reduce risks more than it produces return so it improves the return to risk ratio. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk573.flac
And then. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk574.flac
Sorry if i'm getting technical two types of returns. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk575.flac
There is a beta return screen and an alpha returns. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk576.flac
And what i mean by a beta return stream is that there is an intrinsic reason that asset class will behave in a certain way that you will know another word of growth rises faster. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk577.flac
Discounted an interest rates don't rise my junior all that starts i'm going to go up there is environmental sequence structure. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk578.flac
Alpha is a zero sum game. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk579.flac
Other words for me to produce alpha i have to perform i have to take money away from somebody else is zero sum game like poker at a poker. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk580.flac
So. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk581.flac
Halfords. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk582.flac
And the key is to create good portfolios of good return stream. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk583.flac
None,2023Jun10_220252/chunk584.flac
You have to respond. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk585.flac
Another words of i think if i put 50% of my dollars in stocks and 50% of my dollars in barnes. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk586.flac
But i have my dissertation but that's because the volatility of stocks is greater than twice the volatility and. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk587.flac
And because of that you'll have to wristbands them. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk588.flac
Then the dusting is fine 15 or more good uncorrelated return streams i'll get into that. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk589.flac

10%. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk692.flac
Just imagine i put in an acid. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk693.flac
I'll use the simple example that has 10% return and 10% standard deviation. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk694.flac
So let it's 10%. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk695.flac

This is how my risk in my portfolio wechat. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk705.flac
I mean if you have a diversified portfolio of stock. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk706.flac
Average stock is about 60% correlated with average stocks. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk707.flac
And you can put 100 you can put in a really reduce your. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk708.flac
Relative to puddings. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk709.flac
You know just 5 to 10 and you can see the data lower your risk by. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk710.flac
Canada 15%. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk711.flac
If you have an encore lady. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk712.flac
Return screen and you can get actually better than because you could have negatively correlated bullet say i put in. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk713.flac
An uncorrelated return stream this is how the lion guard. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk714.flac
So you can see like at 5. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk715.flac
You more than cut your risk in here 5 and 4 away return street. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk716.flac
If you have down to 15. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk717.flac
You're going to reduce your risk by nearly 80%. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk718.flac
That means you can prove your return to risk ratio by a factor of 5. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk719.flac
You can reduce your risk a lot without producing in return. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk720.flac
And that is the keynote right. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk721.flac

I think that your two types of assets with your strategic asset allocation next what is your. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk723.flac
Bade another word what portfolio do you normally have. ,2023Jun10_220252/chunk724.flac
